# STREAM Project: Maturity Model for Experimental Materials Data based on FAIR Principles

## Overview

This repository contains a module from the **STREAM** (*Semantic Representation, networking and ‎Curating quality-assured material data‎*) project by **KIT** (*Karlsruhe Institute of Technology*). It includes an Excel file aiming to create a maturity model for experimental materials data following the FAIR principles. This model assists in assessing the maturity level of data based on its Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR).

## File Structure

- `MM_FAIRData.xlsx`: Excel file containing the STREAM module for the maturity model.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository.

## FAIR Principles

The maturity model aligns with the **FAIR** principles, emphasizing:

- **Findability**: Discoverability and location ease of the data.
- **Accessibility**: The ease of access to the data once discovered.
- **Interoperability**: The compatibility for different systems to work together and interpret the data.
- **Reusability**: The adaptability of data for various purposes.

## Usage

### Assessing Maturity Levels

1. Open `Maturity_Model.xlsx` using **Microsoft Excel** or a compatible spreadsheet application.
2. Follow the provided guidelines within the **STREAM** project to assess the experimental materials data based on the **FAIR** principles.
3. Input relevant data and information as required.
4. The model provides a structured approach to evaluate the maturity level of the data in each **FAIR** aspect.

## Contribution
